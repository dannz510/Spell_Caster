## üéÆ Setup & Installation

To set up and run this game locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone or Download:**
    Download or clone this repository to your local machine.

    ```bash
    git clone [repository-url-here]
    cd spell-caster-game
    ```

2.  **SCSS Compilation (Important!):**
    The project uses SCSS for styling. Browsers cannot directly interpret SCSS. You need to compile `style.scss` into `style.css`.

    **Option A: Using Node.js `sass` package (Recommended)**
    * Ensure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed.
    * Install the `sass` compiler globally:
        ```bash
        npm install -g sass
        # or
        yarn global add sass
        ```
    * Navigate to your project directory in the terminal and compile the SCSS:
        ```bash
        sass style.scss style.css
        ```
    * For live compilation during development (recommended), use:
        ```bash
        sass --watch style.scss style.css
        ```

    **Option B: Using an IDE Extension**
    * Many IDEs (like VS Code) have extensions (e.g., "Live Sass Compiler") that can automate this process. Install one and configure it to compile `style.scss` to `style.css`.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run



1.  Open the `index.html` file in your web browser. You can usually do this by double-clicking it.
    * **Note:** For some features (especially if you were to later implement local asset loading or other advanced JavaScript features), it's best to serve the files using a local web server (e.g., `Live Server` extension in VS Code, or Python's `http.server`: `python -m http.server`).
2. Run directly from this URL: [SpellCaster](https://raw.githack.com/dannz510/Spell_Caster/refs/heads/main/Spell%20Caster/index.html)
